def isotropic_plate(R1,R2,nu,thickness):
    '''
    Creates a function for computing the Jacobian of the displacement field 
    for an isotropic plate.

    Parameters
    ----------
    
    R1 : float, 'inf' or None
        The meridional bending radius due to torques (in the same units as R1 
        and thickness). Use 'inf' if the direction is not curved. None sets the 
        corresponding torque to zero and R1 is calculated as an anticlastic
        reaction to the other torque.
        
    R2 : float, 'inf' or None
        The sagittal bending radius due to torques (in the same units as R1 
        and thickness). Use 'inf' if the direction is not curved. None sets the 
        corresponding torque to zero and R1 is calculated as an anticlastic
        reaction to the other torque.
        
    nu : float
        Poisson's ratio of the material.
        
    thickness : float
        The thickness of the crystal (in the same units as R1 and R2)


    Returns
    -------    
        
    jacobian : function
        Returns the partial derivatives of the displacement vector u as a 
        function of coordinates (x,z). The length scale is determined by the
        units of R1, R2 and thickness.

    R1 : float
        The meridional bending radius due to torques (in the units defined by 
        the input). Calculated by the function if due to anticlastic bending.
    
    R2 : float
        The sagittal bending radius due to torques (in the units defined by the
        input). Calculated by the function if due to anticlastic bending.
